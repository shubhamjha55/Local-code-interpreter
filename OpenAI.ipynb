It has a `calculation` method that takes a calculation expression as input and returns the result of the calculation. This method uses the `eval` function to evaluate the expression and handles possible errors such as division by zero or syntax errors. It also formats the result in scientific notation if it is too large.\\n\\nThe `CalculadorValidation` class is responsible for validating the calculation expression before performing the calculation. It checks if the expression is valid and handles errors such as invalid characters or incomplete expressions.\\n\\nThe application uses event handlers to respond to user interactions with the calculator buttons. Each button has a command assigned to it, which is a function that gets executed when the button is clicked. These functions use the methods of the `Calculadora` class to update the input field with the clicked button value or operator.\\n\\nThe application also includes a menu bar with configuration options. Users can change the theme of the calculator by selecting a different theme from the menu. The selected theme is saved in the `settings.json` file and the application is reloaded with the new theme.\\n\\nOverall, this application provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic mathematical calculations.
